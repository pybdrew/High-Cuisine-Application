# High-Cuisine-Application
 
This comprehensive menu management application, developed using the Spring Framework and related technologies, seamlessly integrates Spring MVC for handling views, models, and controllers. Spring Core forms the foundation for business logic and data services, employing Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) to ensure efficient resource management. Spring Data JDBC facilitates data persistence with MySQL, providing a smooth interaction with a relational database. Additionally, Spring REST Services are included to expose APIs, facilitating integration and interaction with external systems. The front end is crafted using Bootstrap, ensuring a responsive, mobile-friendly user interface. Spring Boot packages the application as a standalone JAR, running with an embedded Tomcat server, contributing to its lightweight and easy deployment. The applicationâ€™s backend is backed by a MySQL database, which securely stores menu data and user information.
